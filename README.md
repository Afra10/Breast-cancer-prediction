# Breast Cancer Prediction System



## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive machine learning solution designed to support healthcare professionals in making data-driven decisions regarding breast cancer treatment. Using real-world patient data from the SEER Program (National Cancer Institute), the system predicts mortality status and estimates patient survival time.

## ðŸ§  Key Responsibilities & Achievements

- **Data Engineering & Preprocessing**  
  Cleaned and prepared a real-world SEER breast cancer dataset by handling missing values, performing outlier detection using the IQR method, and conducting feature engineering for classification and regression tasks.

- **Classification Modeling**  
  Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning classifiers including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors to predict patient mortality status. Tuned model performance using GridSearchCV.

- **Ensemble Learning**  
  Designed a probability-based voting ensemble classifier to combine multiple base models, enhancing predictive accuracy and robustness.

- **Regression Analysis**  
  Implemented pruned Decision Tree regression models to estimate survival months for terminal patients, enabling better prioritization in treatment planning.

- **Model Evaluation**  
  Applied metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared. Included ROC curve visualizations and confusion matrices for in-depth model analysis.

- **Healthcare Impact**  
  Translated model outputs into actionable insights for medical professionals to enhance treatment planning and improve patient outcomes.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN
- Ensemble Methods & Decision Trees
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Medical Data Analytics

## ðŸ“ˆ Impact

Developed machine learning tools that help doctors prioritize care and make informed decisions based on predictive insights, potentially contributing to improved cancer treatment and patient survival.
